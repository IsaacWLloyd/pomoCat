You can select menu options by inputting numbers.

The main functionality is the pomodoro option that allows
you to set focus and break timers. After you finish a timer or
exit early you will be asked to rate your focus level.
Depending on wether you completed the entire focus time
and your level of focus you will gain points for each focus block completed.


the idea for how to use this tool is based on the concepts within the following video

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtoysJSQTn8

basically you should start a work session with a short focus timer to make it less intimidating.
Then take a break. Your subsiquent timers should get longer and longer depending on focus level.
when you start to feel that you are in a flow state choose the extend option after a focus timer
and keep flowing!
On the other hand when you start to feel burnt out choose a 20 minute break instead of a 5 and go
do something fun that wont tax your brain

The scoring feature allows you to track your focus over time. The scaling factors are not yet 
optimized and can be adjusted within the settings.py file.
